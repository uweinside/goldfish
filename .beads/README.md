# Beads - AI-Native Issue Tracking

Welcome to Beads! This repository uses **Beads** for issue tracking - a modern, AI-native tool designed to live directly in your codebase alongside your code.

## What is Beads?

Beads is issue tracking that lives in your repo, making it perfect for AI coding agents and developers who want their issues close to their code. No web UI required - everything works through the CLI and integrates seamlessly with git.

## Fresh Clone Setup

The issue database is **not stored in git** (only config is committed). After cloning this repo on a new machine:

1. Install `bd` and `dolt`:
   ```powershell
   # Windows — download binaries to ~/.local/bin
   # bd: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/releases
   # dolt: https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases
   # Or: npm install -g @beads/bd
   ```
2. Initialize a fresh local database:
   ```bash
   bd bootstrap
   ```

That's it — `bd list` will work and you'll start with a clean issue database local to your machine.

> **Note:** Issues are not shared between machines unless you configure a Dolt remote (`bd dolt remote add origin <url>`).

## Quick Start

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Create new issues
bd create "Add user authentication"

# View all issues
bd list

# View issue details
bd show <issue-id>

# Update issue status
bd update <issue-id> --claim
bd update <issue-id> --status done

# Sync with Dolt remote
bd dolt push
```

### Working with Issues

Issues in Beads are:
- **Git-native**: Stored in Dolt database with version control and branching
- **AI-friendly**: CLI-first design works perfectly with AI coding agents
- **Branch-aware**: Issues can follow your branch workflow
- **Always in sync**: Auto-syncs with your commits
